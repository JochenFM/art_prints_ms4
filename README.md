This project allows trade of and information exchange on niche paper collectibles: so-called “Mono-Karten” or “Monos”, advertising cards developed from around 1905 by Swiss editor and entrepreneur Karl Wilhelm Bührer (1861-1917) under the aegis of International Mono Society, founded by Bührer in Winterthur, Switzerland. The cards were designed by then young painters such as Emil Cardinaux, Burkhard Mangold or Ludwig Hohlwein and were collected just as present-day soccer or baseball picture cards. Sized 4x6 inches, the picture side usually contained advertising, whereas on the reverse was a brief statement explaining the content of the picture, with carefully crafted advertising slogans of the companies involved in the idea.
I find these cards aesthetically appealing – the beauty of the images, the quality of the colours and of the lithographic printing are amazing. My site emulates examples such as https://www.galerie123.com/en/ and brings together two logics commonly kept apart: an educational/informational logic, following examples such as https://www.monokartenmatthys.com/ which allows users to display their cards and occasionally blog about them pointing out their historical and artistic value. And a business logic to facilitate trade in these cards and possible profit-making, hitherto often undertaken on Pinterest (https://www.pinterest.ch/michaelv0271/mono-karten-swiss-trade-cards/) or ebay.
The product range can be expanded later on with related paper- and artwork, such as other types of vintage advertising cards or poster art.
